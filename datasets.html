      <h1><u>Event Datasets</u></h1>
      <p>
        Our dataset offers a comprehensive collection of real-world data recordings encompassing a diverse 
        array of scenes and lighting conditions. In total, it comprises over 10 hours of data, 
        ensuring a rich and varied resource for researchers and practitioners.
      </p>
      <p>
        The data collection process spanned an extensive six-month period, with dedicated focus on different 
        lighting conditions. Over six hours of data were meticulously recorded during bright daylight, 
        providing valuable insights into daytime traffic dynamics. Additionally, an equivalent duration 
        was devoted to twilight and post-sunset conditions, shedding light on the unique challenges posed 
        by low-light environments.
      </p>
      <p>
        To enhance the quality of the recorded sequences, each data point underwent a spatio-temporal 
        filtering process. This technique, tailored to emphasize events originating from tangible objects 
        while minimizing noise events, was particularly effective during nighttime data collection. 
        It addressed sensitivity to reflections and pointed light sources from streets and vehicles, 
        ensuring a clearer and more accurate representation of traffic scenarios. It is a simple yet effective 
        filtering technique to de-noise the data, thus leaving scope for some more data preprocessing 
        techniques to be performed.
      </p>

      <p>
        The dataset encompasses a wide range of traffic participant classes, including vehicles such as 
        cars, trucks, buses, trams, bicycles, and even non-motorized participants like pedestrians, 
        cyclists, and wheelchair users. This diverse array of classes opens avenues for in-depth analysis 
        and research aimed at enhancing the safety and efficiency of every traffic participant.
