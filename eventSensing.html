                        <blockquote>
                            Event cameras, designed to replicate the functionality of the human retina, represent a departure from conventional imaging methods. 
                            Instead of sampling light in fixed time intervals, event-based sensors employ pixels that continuously monitor incoming light, only 
                            generating signals when there is a change in light levels. 
                            <br />
                            This process relies on a Contrast Detector (CD), a swift, continuous-time 
                            logarithmic photoreceptor with asynchronous signal processing capabilities. The CD promptly registers alterations in illumination and 
                            issues ON or OFF events, indicating an increase or decrease in intensity beyond predefined thresholds. These events are depicted in 
                            a numerical format that includes the pixel's position in the sensor array (X, Y), polarity (P), denoting positive or negative 
                            contrast changes, and a timestamp (T) indicating the time of the light alteration in microseconds. Consequently, an event data stream 
                            manifests as a series of (X, Y, P, T) tuples, facilitating the processing of dynamic visual information.

                    <p id = "subtopic">Key Advantages of Event Cameras</p>
                    <ul>
                     <li>High Dynamic Range (HDR): Event cameras excel in capturing scenes with a wide range of brightness levels. 
                    This ability ensures that crucial details are not lost in challenging lighting conditions. </li>
                    <li>Exceptional Temporal Resolution: The asynchronous nature of event cameras enables them to 
                    capture rapid changes in real-time. This is particularly vital in scenarios involving fast-moving 
                    objects.</li>
                    <li>Reduced Motion Blur: By focusing on changes in intensity rather than entire frames, event cameras 
                    mitigate the effects of motion blur, ensuring clarity in captured data.</li>
                    <li>Low Power Consumption: Event cameras are designed for efficiency. Their selective capturing of 
                    intensity changes translates to reduced power requirements, making them a sustainable choice for 
                    long-term monitoring applications.
